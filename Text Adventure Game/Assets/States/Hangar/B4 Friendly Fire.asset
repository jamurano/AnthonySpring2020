  storyText: 'You tear off a piece of metal framing from your leather airship pilot
    armor and hold it ready as a shiv of sorts. As the door opens, you rush at your
    ccaptor, leaping like a crazy person and hollering a primal scream of rage.


    Payback time for yout beating and from all the pain these dirty Festers have caused
    your family. You drive home your metal shiv. You hear the crunch of bones and
    feel the slice of flesh.'
